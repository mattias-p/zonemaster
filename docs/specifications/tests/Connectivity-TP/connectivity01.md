## CONNECTIVITY01: UDP connectivity

### Test case identifier

**CONNECTIVITY01:** UDP connectivity

### Objective

DNS queries are sent using UDP on port 53, as described in section 4.2.1 of
[RFC 1035](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1035).

The objective for this test is that all the authoritative name servers for
the domain are accessible over UDP on port 53

### Inputs

The domain to be tested.

### Ordered description of steps to be taken to execute the test case

1. Obtains the IP address of the name servers from [Method4](../Methods.md)
   and [Method5](../Methods.md)
2. A SOA query is sent over UDP to distinct IP addresses of each name server
   found in step 1.
3. If all queries in step 2 receive a DNS answer (bogus responses are not
   checked here) then the test case succeed.
4. If there is any name server that fails to answer queries over port 53 using
   UDP, this test case fails


### Outcome(s)

The outcome of this test case is the severity of the most severe log
message emitted during its execution.

| Log message identifier            | Description    |
|:----------------------------------|:---------------|
| CONNECTIVITY:NAMESERVER_NO_UDP_53 | At least one name server failed to respond with a DNS packet. |
| ...                               | |


### Special procedural requirements	

If either IPv4 or IPv6 transport is disabled, ignore the evaluation of the result of any test using this transport protocol. Log a message reporting on the ignored result.

### Intercase dependencies

None
